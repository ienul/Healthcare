Healthcare system

Design and build a health care system for storing a complete medical history of a user (appointments, diagnoses, the results of medical tests and so on).

Also, a user should be able to see the prices for his medical tests and other treatments. It is expected that the system offers the possibility to add new doctors, together with a list of their services and availability. More scenarios below:

As a basic user, I can:

- see my profile

- see and filter a list with doctors, their availability, prices and specialization

- make an appointment

- see past and future scheduled appointments, past test results, diagnosis

As a doctor, I can:

- see appointments

- edit profile (availability, prices and specialization)

- see patients list

- add diagnosis on patient appointments

As an admin, I can:

- create/add/update/delete - doctors

- create/add/update/delete - patients

- create/add/update/delete - specializations

- create/add/update/delete - services/medical tests
